# Cyber War Simulation

This project is a **Cybersecurity Attack-Defense Simulation** tool that models interactions between attackers and defenders in a network using **Game Theory**, particularly the **Minimax Algorithm**. It includes a dynamic **web interface** with **D3.js-based animations** to visualize threats, defenses, and network risks.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Game-Theory-Based Modeling**  
  Implements the Minimax algorithm to simulate optimal attacker and defender strategies.

- 🌐 **Interactive Web Interface**  
  A browser-based simulation tool built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js for dynamic visualizations.

- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity Concepts**  
  Integrates core concepts from Computer Networks and Discrete Mathematics, including attack trees, threat propagation, and risk evaluation.

- 📊 **Animated Simulations**  
  Visualize attack spread, node vulnerabilities, and defense responses in real-time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – Frontend structure and styling  
- **D3.js** – Network graph and attack-defense animations  
- **Minimax Algorithm** – Game-theory based decision making  
- **JSON** – For threat trees, configurations, or node data  
- *(Optional/Upcoming)* Flask or Node.js for backend (if needed)
